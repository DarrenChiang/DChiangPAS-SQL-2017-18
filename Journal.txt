Over the last few classes, we went over designing database structures through tables
in Excel/Google Sheets. I realized the disadvantages of using such methods. A fully-
fledged database saves both the data attributes and necessary algorithms for data
operations and querying. Excel, when presenting data in different formats for different
purposes, has many redundancies and requires a lot of manual work.

Today I learned about specific attributes for data in databases.
Attributes: properties of data
Simple vs Composite (multiple related simple attributes)
Single-Valued vs Multi-Valued
Stored vs Derived
Complex: collection of attributes to create an abstract attribute (usually derived)
Null Value: purposeful empty value (Null, 99, -1...)
Entity
Entity Type
Entity Set
All entities must have a key attribute: ID.
Value Sets (Domain): limits of an entity, ex: 0-99
